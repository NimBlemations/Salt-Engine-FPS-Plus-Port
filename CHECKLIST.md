# Checklist
This is so you can see planned changes I guess, and to *try* to live up to the license.
The ones that are completed are striked out.

## Visual changes
### One special animation for Salty.
One of the songs make me really want to do this.
### Story menu characters showing up.
I noticed that the story menu image has no other characters other than Salty and Itsumi, then I realized that the characters themselves are being used for the story menu.
### Note splash
Sploosh
## Engine changes
### Input and offset changes
The input is quite annoying when revolving around hold notes, it just doesn't work somehow. And I don't know if it is just me or the offset doesn't do anything, so I'll be changing the offset to be supported universally while compiling the port.
## Charting changes (Unless it destroys the feeling)
### Fix long note collision
I have to say that the long notes either weren't placed very well or **the input sucks**, some of the long notes drag over to the other notes, but I just have a problem with the long note going over to the *other* long note, so I want to change that.
### Redo jacks
The jacks go up to I think about 6 notes, but the jacks feel off pattern.
