# Checklist
This is so you can see planned changes I guess, and to *try* to uniquify this.
The ones that are completed are striked out.

## Visual changes
### One special animation for Salty.
One of the songs make me really want to do this.
### Story menu characters showing up.
I noticed that the story menu image has no other characters other than Salty and Itsumi, then I realized that the characters themselves are being used for the story menu.
### Not including transparent background objects
Salty's Sunday Night seems to have been done by porting assets and offsetting them, along with minor engine changes. And the images that are not there are not seeable
### Note splash
Sploosh
## Engine changes
### Input and offset changes
The input is quite annoying when revolving around hitting *"too many notes"*, it just doesn't work somehow. And I don't know if it is just me or the offset doesn't do anything, so I'll be changing the offset to be supported universally while compiling the port.
## Charting changes (Unless it destroys the feeling)
### Fix long note collision
I have to say that the long notes either weren't placed very well or **the input sucks**, some of the long notes drag over to the other notes, but I just have a problem with the long note going over to the *other* long note, so I want to change that, fixing the long note going over the normal notes as well.
### Redo jacks
The jacks go up to I think about 6 notes, but the jacks feel off pattern.
### Fix unhittable notes
Some notes seem to be unhittable, I might need to check the .json files to verify that the unhittable notes are ones with endless numbers.
## File changes
### Differenciation
I want to differ the file names
